/* USB Device CDC Function Driver Events

  Summary:
    USB Device CDC Function Driver Events

  Description:
    These events are specific to the USB Device CDC Function Driver instance.
    Each event description contains details about the  parameters passed with
    event. The contents of pData depends on the generated event.
    
    Events associated with the CDC Function Driver Specific Control Transfers
    require application response.  The application should respond to these
    events by using the USB_DEVICE_ControlReceive, USB_DEVICE_ControlSend
    and USB_DEVICE_ControlStatus functions.
    
    Calling the USB_DEVICE_ControlStatus function with a
    USB_DEVICE_CONTROL_STATUS_ERROR will stall the control transfer request.
    The application would do this if the control transfer request is not
    supported. Calling the USB_DEVICE_ControlStatus function with a
    USB_DEVICE_CONTROL_STATUS_OK will complete the status stage of the control
    transfer request. The application would do this if the control transfer
    request is supported 
    
    The following code snippet shows an example of a possible event handling
    scheme.

    <code>
    
    // This code example shows all CDC Function Driver events

  Remarks:
    The USB Device CDC control transfer related events allow the application to
    defer responses. This allows the application some time to obtain the
    response data rather than having to respond to the event immediately. Note
    that a USB host will typically wait for event response for a finite time
    duration before timing out and canceling the event and associated
    transactions. Even when deferring response, the application must respond
    promptly if such time outs have to be avoided.

  Description:
    This data type defines the required function signature of the USB Device CDC

    register a pointer to a CDC Function Driver events handling function whose
    function signature (parameter and return value types) match the types
    specified by this function pointer in order to receive event call backs from
    the CDC Function Driver. The function driver will invoke this function with
    event relevant parameters. The description of the event handler function
    parameters is given here.

    instanceIndex           - Instance index of the CDC Function Driver that generated the 
                              event.
    
    event                   - Type of event generated.
    
    pData                   - This parameter should be type cast to an event specific
                              pointer type based on the event that has occurred. Refer 
                              to the USB_DEVICE_CDC_EVENT enumeration description for
                              more details.
    
    context                 - Value identifying the context of the application that 
                              was registered along with the event handling function.

  Remarks:
    The event handler function executes in the USB interrupt context when the
    USB Device Stack is configured for interrupt based operation. It is not
    advisable to call blocking functions or computationally intensive functions
    in the event handler. Where the response to a control transfer related event
    requires extended processing, the response to the control transfer should be
    deferred and the event handler should be allowed to complete execution.

  Summary:
    This function registers a event handler for the specified CDC function
    driver instance. 

  Description:
    This function registers a event handler for the specified CDC function
    driver instance. This function should be called by the client when it
    receives a SET CONFIGURATION event from the device layer. A event handler
    must be registered for function driver to respond to function driver
    specific commands. If the event handler is not registered, the device layer
    will stall function driver specific commands and the USB device may not
    function. 
    
  Precondition:
    This function should be called when the function driver has been initialized
    as a result of a set configuration.

  Parameters:
    instance        - Instance of the CDC Function Driver.

    eventHandler    - A pointer to event handler function.

    context         - Application specific context that is returned in the 
                      event handler.

  Returns:
    USB_DEVICE_CDC_RESULT_OK - The operation was successful
    USB_DEVICE_CDC_RESULT_ERROR_INSTANCE_INVALID - The specified instance does 
    not exist
    USB_DEVICE_CDC_RESULT_ERROR_PARAMETER_INVALID - The eventHandler parameter is

  Summary:
    This function requests a data write to the USB Device CDC Function Driver 
    Layer.

  Description:
    This function requests a data write to the USB Device CDC Function Driver
    Layer. The function places a requests with driver, the request will get
    serviced as data is requested by the USB Host. A handle to the request is
    returned in the transferHandle parameter. The termination of the request is
    indicated by the USB_DEVICE_CDC_EVENT_WRITE_COMPLETE event. The amount of
    data written and the transfer handle associated with the request is returned
    along with the event in writeCompleteData member of the pData parameter in
    the event handler. The transfer handle expires when event handler for the
    USB_DEVICE_CDC_EVENT_WRITE_COMPLETE exits.  If the read request could not be
    accepted, the function returns an error code and transferHandle will contain
    the value USB_DEVICE_CDC_TRANSFER_HANDLE_INVALID.

    The behavior of the write request depends on the flags and size parameter.
    If the application intends to send more data in a request, then it should
    use the USB_DEVICE_CDC_TRANSFER_FLAGS_MORE_DATA_PENDING flag. If there is no
    more data to be sent in the request, the application must use the
    USB_DEVICE_CDC_EVENT_WRITE_COMPLETE flag. This is explained in more detail
    here:
    
    - If size is a multiple of maxPacketSize and flag is set as
    USB_DEVICE_CDC_TRANSFER_FLAGS_DATA_COMPLETE, the write function will append
    a Zero Length Packet (ZLP) to complete the transfer. 
    
    - If size is a multiple of maxPacketSize and flag is set as
    USB_DEVICE_CDC_TRANSFER_FLAGS_MORE_DATA_PENDING, the write function will
    not append a ZLP and hence will not complete the transfer. 
    
    - If size is greater than but not a multiple of maxPacketSize and flags is
    set as USB_DEVICE_CDC_TRANSFER_FLAGS_DATA_COMPLETE, the write function
    returns an error code and sets the transferHandle parameter to
    USB_DEVICE_CDC_TRANSFER_HANDLE_INVALID.
    
    - If size is greater than but not a multiple of maxPacketSize and flags is
    set as USB_DEVICE_CDC_TRANSFER_FLAGS_MORE_DATA_PENDING, the write function
    fails and return an error code and sets the transferHandle parameter to
    USB_DEVICE_CDC_TRANSFER_HANDLE_INVALID.
    
    - If size is less than maxPacketSize and flag is set as
    USB_DEVICE_CDC_TRANSFER_FLAGS_DATA_COMPLETE, the write function schedules
    one packet. 
    
    - If size is less than maxPacketSize and flag is set as
    USB_DEVICE_CDC_TRANSFER_FLAGS_MORE_DATA_PENDING, the write function
    returns an error code and sets the transferHandle parameter to 
    USB_DEVICE_CDC_TRANSFER_HANDLE_INVALID.

    - If size is 0 and the flag is set
    USB_DEVICE_CDC_TRANSFER_FLAGS_DATA_COMPLETE, the function driver will
    schedule a Zero Length Packet.

    Completion of the write transfer is indicated by the 
    USB_DEVICE_CDC_EVENT_WRITE_COMPLETE event. The amount of data written along
    with the transfer handle is returned along with the event.
   
  Precondition:
    The function driver should have been configured.

  Parameters:
    instance  - USB Device CDC Function Driver instance.

    transferHandle - Pointer to a USB_DEVICE_CDC_TRANSFER_HANDLE type of
                     variable. This variable will contain the transfer handle
                     in case the write request was  successful.

    data - pointer to the data buffer that contains the data to written.

    size - Size of the data buffer. Refer to the description section for more
           details on how the size affects the transfer.

    flags - Flags that indicate whether the transfer should continue or end.
            Refer to the description for more details.

  Returns:

    USB_DEVICE_CDC_RESULT_OK - The write request was successful. transferHandle
    contains a valid transfer handle.
    
    USB_DEVICE_CDC_RESULT_ERROR_TRANSFER_QUEUE_FULL - internal request queue 
    is full. The write request could not be added.

    USB_DEVICE_CDC_RESULT_ERROR_TRANSFER_SIZE_INVALID - The specified transfer
    size and flag parameter are invalid.

    USB_DEVICE_CDC_RESULT_ERROR_INSTANCE_NOT_CONFIGURED - The specified

  Remarks:
    While the using the CDC Function Driver with the PIC32MZ USB module, the
    transmit buffer provided to the USB_DEVICE_CDC_Write function should be placed
    in coherent memory and aligned at a 16 byte boundary.  This can be done by
    declaring the buffer using the  __attribute__((coherent, aligned(16)))
    attribute. An example is shown here

  Remarks:
    While the using the CDC Function Driver with the PIC32MZ USB module, the
    receive buffer provided to the USB_DEVICE_CDC_Read function should be placed
    in coherent memory and aligned at a 16 byte boundary.  This can be done by
    declaring the buffer using the  __attribute__((coherent, aligned(16)))
    attribute. An example is shown here

  Summary:
    This function schedules a request to send serial state notification to the host.

  Description:
    This function places a request to send serial state notification data to the
    host. The function will place the request with the driver, the request will
    get serviced when the data is requested by the USB host.  A handle to the
    request is returned in the transferHandle parameter. The termination of the
    request is indicated by the
    USB_DEVICE_CDC_EVENT_SERIAL_STATE_NOTIFICATION_COMPLETE event. The amount of
    data transmitted and the transfer handle associated with the request is
    returned along with the event in the serialStateNotificationCompleteData
    member of pData parameter of the event handler. The transfer handle expires
    when the event handler for the
    USB_DEVICE_CDC_EVENT_SERIAL_STATE_NOTIFICATION_COMPLETE event exits. If the
    send request could not be accepted, the function returns an error code and
    transferHandle will contain the value
    USB_DEVICE_CDC_TRANSFER_HANDLE_INVALID.

  Precondition:
    The function driver should have been configured

  Parameters:
    instance        - USB Device CDC Function Driver instance.
    
    transferHandle  - Pointer to a output only variable that will contain transfer
                      handle.
    
    notificationData - USB_DEVICE_CDC_SERIAL_STATE_NOTIFICATION type of
                       notification data to be sent to the host.

  Returns:
    USB_DEVICE_CDC_RESULT_OK - The request was successful. transferHandle
    contains a valid transfer handle.
    
    USB_DEVICE_CDC_RESULT_ERROR_TRANSFER_QUEUE_FULL - Internal request queue 
    is full. The request could not be added.

    USB_DEVICE_CDC_RESULT_ERROR_INSTANCE_NOT_CONFIGURED - The specified 
    instance is not configured yet.

    USB_DEVICE_CDC_RESULT_ERROR_INSTANCE_INVALID - The specified instance
    was not provisioned in the application and is invalid.

  Example:
    <code>

    USB_CDC_SERIAL_STATE notificationData;
    
    // This application function could possibly update the notificationData
    // data structure.

    APP_UpdateNotificationData(&notificationData);

    // Now send the updated notification data to the host.

    result = USB_DEVICE_CDC_SerialStateNotificationSend
                (instanceIndex, &transferHandle, &notificationData);
    
    if(USB_DEVICE_CDC_RESULT_OK != result)
    {
        // Error handling here. The transferHandle will contain
        // USB_DEVICE_CDC_TRANSFER_HANDLE_INVALID in this case.
    }

  Remarks:
    While the using the CDC Function Driver with the PIC32MZ USB module, the
    notification data buffer provided to the
    USB_DEVICE_CDC_SerialStateNotificationSend function should be placed in
